<p style="color:red;">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition and machine vision.</p>
<p style="color:black;">AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.</p>
</body>
<p style="color:black;"><b>1-Learning processes:</b> This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.</h1>
<p><b>2-Reasoning processes:</b> This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.</p>
<p><b>3-Self-correction processes:</b> This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>Artificial neural networks and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are quickly evolving, primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much faster and makes predictions more accurately than humanly possible.</p>
<p style="color:green"> <b>While the huge volume of data being created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications that use machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. As of this writing, the primary disadvantage of using AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data that AI programming requires.</b></p>
